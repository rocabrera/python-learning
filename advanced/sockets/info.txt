#Blocking calls 

A socket function or method that temporarily suspends your application is a blocking call. 
For example, accept(), connect(), send(), and recv() “block.” They don’t return immediately. 
Blocking calls have to wait on system calls (I/O) to complete before they can return a value. 
So you, the caller, are blocked until they’re done or a timeout or other error occurs.
